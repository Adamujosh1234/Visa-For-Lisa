## Task
The task at hand involves performing data cleaning, analysis, and a machine learning classification task on a bank's customer database stored as a CSV file.

## Description
To tackle this problem, I have utilized various modules, including the popular sklearn module for machine learning operations in Python.
In order to visualize the analysis, I have imported the plotly and seaborn modules.

Here is the step-by-step process I followed:
1. Imported pandas to load the data.
2. Since there are no missing values, I assigned the appropriate data types to the features in the dataset.
3. Used the seaborn library to plot histograms and a heatmap of the dataset.
4. Imported the sklearn module, which provides extensive support for machine learning and other operations.

## Installation
There is no specific installation required for this project. 
However, to ensure the project works effectively, it is recommended to have Jupyter Notebooks installed locally through Anaconda.

## Usage
To use this script, open it in Jupyter Notebook. Make sure the CSV file is present in the same directory as the script.
Once the script is open in Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the Menu, click on "Cells," and select "Run all Cells" to execute the script.
